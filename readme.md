1 ½ cups water
⅓ cup rice vinegar 
¼ cup lemon juice
2 ½ tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons orange juice
1 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons chopped green onion
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
½ teaspoon minced fresh ginger root
½ teaspoon minced garlic
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
3 tablespoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons water
Chicken:
2 large skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 cup all-purpose flour
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon pepper
3 tablespoons olive oil


Combine water, rice vinegar, lemon juice, soy sauce, and orange juice for sauce into a saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in brown sugar, green onion, orange zest, ginger, garlic, and pepper flakes; bring to a boil. Remove from heat, and cool for 10 to 15 minutes.

Step 2
Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag. Pour in 1 cup cooled sauce. Seal the bag, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Reserve the remaining sauce.

Step 3
Mix flour, salt, and pepper in another resealable plastic bag.

Step 4
Remove chicken from the marinade and place into the bag of seasoned flour. Seal the bag and shake to coat.

Step 5
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken in the hot skillet until browned on both sides. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and cover with aluminum foil. Wipe out the skillet.

Step 6
Pour reserved sauce into the skillet and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.

Step 7
Mix together cornstarch and water until completely smooth. Stir into the boiling sauce. Reduce heat to medium-low, add the chicken, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, about 5 minutes.
